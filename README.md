## About Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. It transforms plain text files (Markdown, HTML, Liquid templates) into a complete static website, generating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for deployment. Jekyll is popular for personal sites, blogs, and documentation, and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- `_config.yml`: Main configuration for Jekyll (site settings, plugins, theme options).
- `Gemfile`: Ruby gem dependencies for Jekyll and plugins.
- `package.json`: JavaScript dependencies for build tools or enhancements.
- `_data/`: YAML files for structured data like navigation and UI text.
- `_includes/`: Reusable HTML/Liquid partials (navigation, analytics, comments, etc.).
- `_layouts/`: Page and post layout templates.
- `_sass/`: SCSS partials for site styling, including theme skins and custom overrides.
- `assets/`: Contains CSS (`assets/css/`) and JavaScript (`assets/js/`) for site styling and interactivity.
- `_pages/`: Custom pages (About, Projects, 404, etc.).
- `images/`: Image assets for the site.
- `staticman.yml`: Configuration for Staticman (comment system).
- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- Other files like `Rakefile`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` are for automation, documentation, and licensing.
