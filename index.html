Hi, I create and design stuff around Android.
<br/>

I currently work at Airbuzz as a Sr. Android developer. In the past I've worked with a few startups mainly around mobile. I have most of my stuff on Github. I'm a Assam Engineering College 2011 MCA alumni and I'm based out of Guwahati for a while.
<br/>

I dish out code during the day and electronic bullets by the night. I love wildlife documentaries and a big admirer of wild cats. House MD is my favorite.
