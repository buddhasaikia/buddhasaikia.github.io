<b>Hi</b>, I create and design stuff around Android.
<br/><br/>

I currently work at <a href="http://www.airwhizz.com/">Airbuzz</a> as a Sr. Android developer. In the past I have worked
 with a few startups and premium institution like <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/">IIT Guwahati</a>. I have most of my stuff on Github.
 I am a <a href="http://www.aec.ac.in/">Assam Engineering College</a> 2011 MCA alumni and I am based out of Guwahati for a while.
<br/><br/>

I love wildlife documentaries and a big admirer of wild cats. <i>Man Vs. Wild</i> is my favorite.
<br/><br/>
